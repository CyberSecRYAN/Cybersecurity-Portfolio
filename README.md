# 📂 Cybersecurity Portfolio  

👋 Welcome! I’m **Ryan Mihalics-Shaw**, an aspiring **cybersecurity professional** with a focus on **ethical hacking, network security, and cyber defense**. This portfolio showcases my hands-on projects, security research, and technical skills.  

## 🔹 About Me  
I am passionate about **protecting organizations from cyber threats** by leveraging my skills in **risk assessment, incident response, and penetration testing**. My goal is to contribute to a **strong security posture** in an organization by identifying vulnerabilities and implementing proactive defense strategies.  

## 📌 Projects & Skills  
🔹 [Security Audit Report](#security-audit-report)

## Executive Summary
This security audit report evaluates the current security posture of [Company Name / System]. 
The assessment covers key areas such as network security, access controls, and vulnerability management.

## Scope of Audit
- Network Infrastructure Security
- Application Security
- Endpoint Security
- Identity & Access Management

## Findings  
### 🔹 Issue #1: Weak Password Policy  
   - **Impact:** Users can set short, weak passwords, increasing the risk of brute-force attacks.  
   - **Recommendation:** Implement a **strong password policy** requiring at least **12 characters, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols**.  

### 🔹 Issue #2: Unpatched Software Vulnerabilities  
   - **Impact:** Outdated versions of **Apache and OpenSSL** expose the system to **CVE-2023-1234**, allowing remote code execution.  
   - **Recommendation:** Apply security patches and enable **automatic updates** for critical infrastructure.  

### 🔹 Issue #3: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
   - **Impact:** If a password is compromised, attackers can access sensitive accounts without additional authentication.  
   - **Recommendation:** Enforce **MFA for all privileged accounts** and encourage MFA adoption for regular users.  
### Conclusion
Overall, [Company Name / System] has a [good/moderate/poor] security posture. Immediate remediation steps should include:

- [Action 1]  
- [Action 2]  
- [Action 3]
